Nomination pools are a way of "permissionlessly allow members to pool their funds together and act as a single nominator account." (from the [wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-nomination-pools)). The main purpose is to allow smaller nominators to combine their nominations into a bigger nomination pool, so that there is a bigger chance of joining an active validator and thus earn rewards.

See also [nominate](nominate) for more information about nominating.
