### Got a bad approval from peer peer_id=PeerId(“…”) error=Unknown block: …
kusama validator lounge: “That’s known and being investigated, but should be benign and does not affect era points” by rphmeier

### Incoming substream exceeding maximum number of negotiating inbound streams. Dropping
kusama validator lounge: "This one is not too big of an issue so long as it isn’t being emitted constantly (as in multiple times per second)" by will

### Cannot create a runtime error=Other("cannot create module: compilation settings are not compatible with the native host") Error at calling runtime api: Failed to get runtime version: cannot create module: compilation settings are not compatible with the native host
This seems to be a problem with virtualized hosts, especially KVM which don't show their CPU right or show "Generic KVM CPU". The solution seems to be to set the CPU to `passthrough (host)` https://qemu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system/qemu-cpu-models.html#libvirt-guest-xml
